      <h2>1 Bag = 1 Day of School</h2>
      <p>We are a social venture and at the heart of our operation lies our strongly held belief that every child deserves equal access to education. Unfortunately in 2019 many children in Guatemala are denied that which others of us take for granted. Outside of the capital, Guatemala City, educational attainment still stands at just 5th grade elementary.</p>
      <p>(Source: <a href="https://www.ine.gob.gt/sistema/uploads/2016/02/03/bWC7f6t7aSbEI4wmuExoNR0oScpSHKyB.pdf">Instituto Nacional de Estadistica, Guatemala</a>)</p>
      <br>
      <p>Not only is this completely unacceptable, it is something that, working together, we can change for the better. By joining the Madsen Cacao Movement you are contributing your part so that, scholarship by scholarship, child by child, every Guatemalan has a chance to obtain a dignified and practical education for the 21st century.</p>
